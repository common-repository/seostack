Improve the internal search results with this plugin. Live search, spelling and synonyms are supported.

== Description ==

*Live search should be available on every site. With this plugin, you finally can get it.*

The SEOStack plugin will improve the internal site search. You will also get live search, and this plugin integrates with the default search widget and your theme.

#### Major features in the Live Search by SEOStack plugin include:
- Live search for the default search widget
- Automatically update the search index, so your visitors find the newest information on your site.
- Spelling suggestion is a self-learning process and supported in real time searches.
- Common synonyms are used for the search queries, so more content will be found.
- Integrations with popular plugins and custom post types
- For developers: Vanilla javascript, no jQuery used in the frontend.

PS: You'll need an SEOStack.io API key to use it. You can generate an API key for **free** in the WP admin, with a limit of 250 documents and 2.500 requests a month. When you're running out of requests, we have paid subscriptions available for [hosted site search](https://seostack.io/hosted-site-search/).

### Internal site search

Improve the internal site search and give your users a better experience on your site. If users can find what they're looking for, then the CTR and conversion will probably increase as well.

When this plugin is activated, it will use the default search widget on your website. You can change the colors of the live search box, so it integrates on your site very easily.

Unlike others, we won't show any ads!

#### Plugin and custom post type compatibility

This plugin integrates with custom post types which are publicly available on your site. We also integrate with the popular ecommerce plugin, WooCommerce. This integration is enabled by default.

**Supported plugins**
We're trying to use relevant information only for indexing your site. This site search plugin has *extended functionality* with these plugins:
- WooCommerce
- Yoast SEO

### SEOStack Site Search API

To use our services, you must create a free api key so we can verify that you own a site and you can update the content in the search results. **The key can be created within the WordPress admin in the one-time setup for free.**

> **Upgrade your API key**<br /><br />
> By default, the API key can store 250 documents in the SEOStack live search API. If you have more pages, you'll need to upgrade your key.<br /><br />
> **Premium support**<br /><br />
> As a customer you deserve the best support, so we offer premium support. Simply by using the support form on our website.<br /><br />

This plugin integrates your WordPress site to the live search SEOStack.io API. We use our API to handle the searches on your site.

Privacy: We only store data that is publicly visible. For example, we use the title, content, excerpt and the name of the author. We don't save an email address from the author.

#### Translations
This site search plugin is currently available in English and Dutch. Would you like to help us with the translation? You may want to use the [generated .pot file](https://github.com/seostack/seostack-for-wordpress/blob/develop/languages) on our GitHub page.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the files in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. Do not forget to activate the SEOStack plugin in your WP admin.

Note: This plugin needs at least PHP 5.3+ to work as expected. PHP 5.2 is NOT supported. This plugin needs the PHP modules: cURL and filter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =
The default site search functionality has less support for typo's and synonyms. Our site search algorithm is much better than the default functionality and updated regularly. Some competitors show ads on their free plans, but we will never do that.

We will even add a fancy live search results box to your default search widget. This will help increasing the CTR of your site!

= Can I use this plugin for free? =
Yes, you can! By default, you'll get a free API key. With this key, you can sync 250 documents (pages, posts, products etc.) to our API. If you have more content, you should upgrade the key on our website.

= I want to report a feature or bug =
Plugin issues (or features) can be reported in our [SEOStack for WordPress GitHub repository](https://github.com/seostack/seostack-for-wordpress/issues).

= Where can I upgrade my API key? =
We have paid subscriptions available for our [hosted site search](https://seostack.io/hosted-site-search/) service. After you've upgraded your API key, the new subscription is activated immediately.

= The index process is not working, what can I do? =
First of all, make sure all plugins, themes and your WordPress installation are up-to-date. When you've double checked that, and the indexing is still not working, please create a support request.
